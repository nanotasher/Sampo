# Sampo
Sampo is an experimental, AI-assisted algorithmic trading platform designed to run via containerization, combining real-time market data, a rules-driven decision engine, and an LLM explanation layer. The system streams live price feeds via API, maintains a dynamic watchlist, evaluates trading opportunities using configurable strategy profiles, and routes all proposed trades through a human permission gate. 

This repository currently contains the minimal skeleton for the API, worker loop, and deployment infrastructure as the foundation for the full trading engine.
